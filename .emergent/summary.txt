The AI engineer's work primarily focused on transforming Idle Ninja Online from a local to an online RPG. Initial development involved re-architecting UI overlays and implementing a boss battle system, followed by a major visual overhaul to a Mythic-Tech theme. The core of this trajectory centered on building a secure authentication system, integrating server-side progression, and fixing numerous associated bugs. Key challenges included resolving persistent UI layering, managing Expo SDK updates leading to  errors, and a recurring critical bug where user progress was lost or overwritten by default game states. The engineer iteratively addressed issues like auto-login failures, a stuck loading screen, and ensuring frontend auto-saves correctly reached the backend, often facing regressions and needing deep debugging, including manual database checks. The latest work involves fixing Expo Go compatibility errors and tackling the persistent progress corruption.

The application is an Idle Ninja Online style mobile RPG. It features an auto-fighting character across 50 zones (5 levels each, 1000 enemy defeats). Progression includes XP to level 15000, 3 stat points per level, and level-up explosions. The UI has a battle arena with bottom tabs for Stats, Abilities, Pets, Skills, Store, Raids, and Equipment, appearing as overlays. A tick-based combat engine is foundational. Implemented features include a 50-zone system, 25-level gear progression with material upgrades, and a Boss Battle System with 4 bosses across 5 tiers, daily tickets, and specific drops. Boss battles feature unique backgrounds, element-specific attacks, WIN/DEFEAT popups, 3 player lives with a 5-second respawn, and dynamic boss sizing/difficulty. The UI adopted a Mythic-Tech theme with futuristic aesthetics, neon elements, and a compact top bar with vertically stacked resources. Enemies are cleared during boss fights, and bosses are 3x larger. The current development includes a comprehensive, secure server-side login and progression system to prevent client-side cheating, with an upcoming need for Companions and Idle/Offline Progression.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep-diving into persistent critical bugs: the user's game progress being overwritten by default data (reverting from Level 18 to Level 1) and continuous login prompts.

The debugging process involved:
1.  **Backend Verification**: Confirmed that the database sometimes contained real user progress (e.g., Level 8 or Level 14/18 at different points), but also numerous Level 1 default saves, indicating a race condition or aggressive overwrite. Manual database checks showed no recent saves for the actual user account, despite frontend logs indicating save requests.
2.  **Frontend Auto-Save Investigation**: Discovered that the  flag in  was often  even after a successful login, preventing the auto-save  from running. This led to  reaching the backend for authenticated users.
3.  **Authentication State Debugging**: Added extensive logging to  to trace  and  states during login and session checks, attempting to understand why  was .
4.  **Expo Go Compatibility**: The user reported 3 errors in the Expo Go app. The AI identified  and  object access as potential web-specific issues that don't work on mobile. Initial fixes included platform-specific  usage. Further general fixes for Expo Go compatibility (e.g.,  import,  for animations) were attempted.

The current state is that user progress is still being lost, and the system is regressing to saving default Level 1 states, indicating that the core persistence bug is still active despite numerous targeted fixes. The Expo Go errors are also unconfirmed as fixed due to the overarching persistence issue.

Address the recurring progress loss by systematically debugging the  state in  and  to ensure auto-saves trigger for logged-in users.
