The AI engineer's work primarily involved a series of iterative feature implementations and bug fixes for an Expo mobile application, Idle Ninja Online. Key feature developments included integrating the Shadow Clone ability with specific visual and functional requirements (semi-transparent, single clone, player-following, 70% damage attacks) and a comprehensive store system featuring three tabs (Items, Subscriptions, Gems) with server-side managed subscription benefits (XP and zone kill multipliers). A name change functionality was also added, allowing one free change with case-insensitive uniqueness validation. Significant effort was dedicated to fixing persistent data persistence issues across character upgrades, skill points, and store purchases, often requiring deep dives into  and  to ensure proper state management and MongoDB serialization. Multiple network request failures were debugged, tracing back to incorrect environment variable usage and lingering  processes, which were systematically resolved to restore proper frontend-backend communication. The zone progression was also scaled for max level 15,000.

Idle Ninja Online is a mobile RPG with auto-fighting across 50 zones, character progression to level 15000, stat points, and level-up animations. It features a battle arena and bottom tabs for Stats, Abilities, Pets, Skills, Store, Raids, and Equipment, adhering to a Mythic-Tech theme. Core mechanics include a 50-zone system, 25-level gear progression with material upgrades, and a 5-tier Boss Battle System. Secure, server-side login and progression using Expo (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB are critical.

Recent work focused on:
- **Shadow Clone Ability:** Implement a shadow clone that is semi-transparent, casts duplicate attacks at 70% damage, has a max of 1 clone, and follows the player.
- **Store System:** Create a 3-tab store (Items, Subscriptions, Gems). Subscriptions tab needs two 30-day, 0 items: a global 2x EXP/Drop buff and a 2x zone kill progression multiplier, both server-time based and persistent.
- **Character Management:** Implement event-driven saves for skill/gold point upgrades in the character tab. Implement a name change feature with 1 free change, then .99, including unique, case-insensitive name validation.
- **Game Progression:** Triple base XP values. Scale all 50 zones for progression from level 1 to 15,000.
- **Bugs & Stability:** Fix network request failures (server saves, subscription loading, login), console errors visibility, and name change resetting progress. Ensure server-only game saves.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the implementation and debugging of several critical features and bug fixes. The **Shadow Clone system** is fully functional, rendering a semi-transparent clone near the player that follows movements and casts duplicate attacks at 70% damage, with a single clone limit. The **store system** has been overhauled into a 3-tab interface (Items, Subscriptions, Gems). Two subscription items (2x XP/Drop Boost and 2x Zone Kill Boost) are implemented, with server-side management ensuring persistence and proper application of multipliers in combat and zone progression. A **name change feature** is available in the store, offering one free change and then a .99 cost, with robust case-insensitive uniqueness validation. The backend registration system has been updated for unique username validation. All **XP values** (base and zone-specific) have been tripled, and all **50 zones have been rescaled** to support seamless progression up to level 15,000. Significant effort was put into resolving data persistence issues with character upgrades and skill points, network request failures for API calls, and login, by correcting environment variable usage (), killing a lingering  process, and fixing variable access in React Contexts. Console errors were suppressed, ensuring only user-friendly popups are displayed for issues like name change failures. The local backup system was completely removed to enhance security. The MongoDB database was analyzed to explain the presence of multiple game saves.
