The previous AI engineer's work focused on transforming the Idle Ninja Online Expo mobile app from a basic state, addressing numerous mobile-specific challenges. Initial efforts stabilized the app by resolving rendering issues () and authentication problems. The core development involved implementing a circular abilities layout and a player movement system. This journey was punctuated by persistent mobile layout inconsistencies, React render-phase violations, and threading issues with  (for the joystick). The AI engineer extensively utilized the troubleshoot agent to diagnose and resolve complex bugs, systematically migrating web-centric code patterns to mobile-compatible ones. Key areas of correction included: ability icon rendering, responsive layout calculations, header styling,  replacement, projectile animation, and especially refining the joystick implementation from  to simple touch events to overcome crashes, and finally, robust state management across contexts to prevent update conflicts and implement auto-movement and enemy tracking.

<product_requirements>
The Idle Ninja Online is a mobile RPG featuring auto-fighting across 50 zones, character progression up to level 15000, stat points, and level-up animations. The UI includes a battle arena and bottom tabs for Stats, Abilities, Pets, Skills, Store, Raids, and Equipment, all themed Mythic-Tech. It incorporates a 50-zone system, 25-level gear progression with material upgrades, and a 5-tier Boss Battle System with daily tickets, unique attacks, and dynamic difficulty. Enemies are cleared during boss fights, and bosses are three times larger. A critical requirement is secure, server-side login and progression to prevent client-side cheating. The application uses Expo (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB (database). So far, the application has stable loading, authentication, and core combat functionality with mobile-optimized UI, header, and overlay displays. Recent updates include a circular abilities layout, and a functional player movement system with both auto-movement and a mobile-safe virtual joystick, with enemies now tracking the player.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing persistent stuttering issues with the manual joystick movement and confirming that enemies were not automatically tracking the player. The troubleshoot agent identified two critical root causes: the joystick stuttering was due to a high  and a  dependency in a  causing excessive re-renders. The enemy AI was still implementing random movement instead of tracking the player.

The AI engineer's last actions were to systematically fix these issues:
1.  **Joystick Stuttering Fix**: The  was reduced, and the  dependency was removed from relevant  hooks controlling both joystick and auto-movement to prevent unnecessary re-renders in .
2.  **Enemy AI Fix**: The enemy movement logic in  was modified to make enemies track toward the closest player instead of performing purely random movement. Player auto movement speed was set to 3x original and joystick movement speed to 3x original, while enemy movement speed was set to 2.5x original.

The service was restarted after these changes. The goal of these changes was to eliminate the stuttering for a smoother manual control experience and to implement a more engaging enemy AI where enemies actively seek out the player, aligning with typical idle game combat mechanics.

The last action was to restart the Expo service after implementing fixes for joystick stuttering and enemy tracking. The next logical step is to verify these changes on a mobile device.
