The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles the development of an Idle Ninja Online-style mobile game in Expo. Initial efforts focused on establishing core auto-combat, XP, and level-up systems, meticulously resolving numerous React stale closure issues within  and  hooks, often with  assistance. Key features like a level-up explosion, a Store tab, and a refactored Skills tab were successfully integrated. The agent demonstrated persistence in fixing recurring XP and movement bugs, refining state management. The most recent significant work involved integrating a new tick-based combat engine, a foundational architectural shift for future complex idle RPG features. The current task is restoring the full game UI after resolving a persistent loading screen, with styling in progress.

The project's goal is to develop a mobile application from an existing web-based ninja idle game, emulating Idle Ninja Online. Core gameplay requires an auto-fighting character navigating a map against 10-20 auto-spawning enemies. Progression involves XP per kill, incremental EXP scaling to level 15000, and 3 stat points per level. The UI/UX mandates a battle arena as the main page, with other features accessed via bottom tabs opening as overlay modals, and smooth character movement. Explicit feature additions include a level-up explosion killing all on-screen enemies and granting XP, a Store tab for in-app gem purchases, and renaming/refactoring the Training tab to Skills while removing training activities. A comprehensive future vision encompasses a tick-based combat engine, 5-ability deck, enhanced enemies/zones, boss battles, gear/equipment, companions, and offline progression simulation.

**Key Files and Changes:**

-   : This is the primary game screen, responsible for rendering the battle arena, character, enemies, and integrating the overall game logic, including the new . It was heavily refactored to manage state, resolve stale closures in combat/movement logic, and recently adapted to integrate the new .
-   : Wraps all application routes, now includes both  and  to ensure global access to game and combat states.
-   : (Renamed from  and moved from  to ) Manages the global game state, including ninja stats, XP, level, and resources. Extensive work was done to fix XP accumulation, level-up logic, and address React render loop issues using  and .
-    (NEW): Provides the  and related combat states throughout the application, facilitating the new tick-based combat system.
-    (NEW): Implements the core logic for the new tick-based combat system, including ability management and damage calculations, serving as the foundation for future RPG features.
-   : Renders the bottom navigation. Modified to include the Store tab, rename Training to Skills, and update  types to reflect these changes.
-   : (Renamed from ) Refactored to remove training activities and now focuses solely on skill point allocation.
-    (NEW): A new component for displaying gem packages and facilitating in-app purchases.
-    (NEW): A visual component activated during player level-ups to display an explosion animation.
-    (NEW): Displays combat-related information and ability slots, integrating with the new .
-    (NEW),  (NEW): Custom hooks for easier interaction with the  and ability management, respectively.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently engaged in restoring the full game user interface for the main game screen, . This follows the successful integration of a new **Tick-Based Combat Engine** and the resolution of a critical bug that caused the application to get stuck on an indefinite Loading... screen.

Previously, the  component was failing to correctly access the  object from , leading to an undefined error during initialization. This was identified as a mismatch where the component was directly destructuring  while  provided  (which contained ). The fix involved adjusting  to correctly access . After this fix, a simplified  successfully rendered Ninja Loaded! Level 1, confirming the underlying data flow was functional.

The user then highlighted that the screen remained static, prompting the current task: to replace the temporary Ninja Loaded! Level 1 message with the complete game visual elements. This involves re-implementing the display of the ninja character, enemies, and the new  component that interacts with the recently integrated . The AI's immediate action is to add the necessary CSS styles to properly render these components, ensuring the game visually reflects the new architectural changes.
