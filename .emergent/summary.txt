The AI engineer's trajectory details an iterative debugging and feature implementation process for an Expo mobile game. Initially, the core task was restoring the game UI after a Loading... screen fix. This quickly evolved into addressing a blank screen due to duplicate code in , then a URL redirection issue. Subsequently, the focus shifted to fixing a broken XP/leveling system and visual discrepancies. Recurring challenges included React context nesting issues, stale state, and caching, often necessitating  intervention and multiple expo restarts. The AI implemented and refined enemy spawning, unique ID generation, dynamic enemy positioning, and a visual projectile system. Key successes include a fully functional XP system with proper resets, 10 visible enemies, and a running combat loop. Pending issues are primarily related to the level-up explosion not damaging enemies and the projectile system's full integration with damage.

The goal is to develop a mobile idle RPG resembling Idle Ninja Online. Core gameplay involves an auto-fighting character in a battle arena against 10-20 auto-spawning enemies. Progression features XP per kill (incrementally scaling up to level 15000), and 3 stat points per level. The UI/UX prioritizes a battle arena as the main screen, with other features (Stats, Abilities, Pets, Skills, Store, Raids) accessible via bottom tabs opening as overlay modals. Specific features include a level-up explosion (killing all on-screen enemies), a Store tab for in-app gem purchases, and a refactored Training tab renamed to Skills focusing on skill point allocation. The application utilizes a new tick-based combat engine, designed to support future complex features like a 5-ability deck, enhanced enemies, boss battles, gear, companions, and offline progression.

**Directory Structure:**


-   : This is the main game screen. It was initially heavily refactored for combat/movement logic and  integration.
    -   **Changes**: Removed duplicate code causing a blank screen. Integrated , . Added projectile rendering and animation logic. Implemented XP tracking (later refactored/removed). Integrated  and  calls from . Fixed console.log outside JSX. Adjusted enemy rendering positioning and increased size for visibility.
-   : Wraps all application routes, providing  and  for global state.
    -   **Changes**: Reviewed for context nesting issues; refactored  setup to avoid circular dependencies with .
-   : Manages global game state (ninja stats, XP, level, resources).
    -   **Changes**: Refined XP accumulation, level-up logic, and addressed render loop issues. Added debugging for XP updates and level checks. Logic for XP reset on level-up was confirmed to be correct.
-   : Provides the  and combat states for the new tick-based combat system.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated with  for XP rewards upon enemy kills. Removed tick counter display from its scope. Fixed duplicate import of . Modified enemy spawning logic to maintain 10 enemies, randomizing their positions. Implemented  utility. Added  and  functions to manage enemies. Adjusted  to directly call  from .
-   : Implements core tick-based combat logic.
    -   **Changes**: Reviewed for combat tick execution and ability casting, specifically ensuring  is registered and running.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Fully integrate Projectile System**: Ensure projectiles damage enemies and visual targeting is accurate.
-   **Level-up Explosion Damage**: Make the level-up explosion actively clear/damage enemies.
-   **Auto-movement System**: Restore the ninja's auto-movement feature.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in resolving two significant bugs: the level-up explosion not damaging enemies and projectiles not visually targeting correctly or dealing damage.

The AI confirmed that the XP and level-up system is now fully functional, correctly resetting XP after level-ups (e.g., Level 3 with 90/115 XP). The system also properly detects enemy deaths, awards XP and gold, and updates character progression. Ten enemies are visibly distributed across the battle arena, and the combat system is active.

The level-up explosion's visual effect and detection are working, but it currently does not damage or clear enemies. The AI attempted to integrate  from  into the 's explosion trigger, but this function was not being called correctly, indicating a context integration issue or scope problem. An attempt to move  into  also resulted in the function not being called.

For the projectile system, while the AI previously observed projectiles rendering and targeting correctly in a specific debugging run, the most recent tests showed that no projectiles were being created or detected by the logging system. The AI decided to move towards a more direct integration approach for the projectile system, rather than relying on  detection, to address dependency issues and ensure consistent functionality.

<optional_next_step>
Integrate the projectile system directly with the combat engine to ensure they cause damage and are consistently rendered.
