The AI engineer successfully initiated a mobile app project from a GitHub repository, overcoming initial access issues. The core request evolved from converting a web app to building an Idle Ninja Online-style mobile game. The AI systematically set up the Expo project, implemented game state management, and created core UI components, including a main battle arena and bottom tab navigation for overlays. Significant effort was dedicated to developing a real-time auto-battle system with enemy spawning, character movement, and an experience/level-up system. Challenges included fixing  imports, resolving nested  in , and refining character smooth movement. Currently, the AI is debugging a critical bug where the XP bar is not visible on the main screen, and the level-up logic is failing to trigger despite correct XP accumulation, indicating a problem within  or rendering.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested to create a mobile app from an existing web application hosted on a GitHub repository (). This application was identified as a JavaScript-based React web app, described as a ninja idle game. The primary goal was to create a comprehensive mobile version.

The requirements evolved to build a game similar to Idle Ninja Online, incorporating:
-   **Core Gameplay:** A controllable character that can walk around a map and attack enemies.
-   **Automation:** Auto-fighting capabilities and automatic enemy spawning to maintain 10-20 enemies on screen.
-   **Progression:** XP should be awarded per kill, incremental EXP scaling up to level 15000, and 3 stat points granted per level.
-   **UI/UX:** The battle arena should be the main page, with all other features accessible via bottom tabs that open as overlays, mirroring Idle Ninja Online layout. Smooth character movement, not instant.
-   **Display:** An accurate XP bar on the main screen showing current level progression.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Expo & Expo Router:** Framework for mobile app development and file-based routing.
-   **React Native:** Core UI components and styling.
-   **Zustand:** State management for game state ().
-   **React Native Animated API:** Used for smooth character movement and animations.
-   **AsyncStorage:** For client-side data persistence (implicitly used for game state).
-   **FastAPI & MongoDB:** Backend architecture for potential API and database interactions.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack setup: an Expo frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

-   : Updated to include dependencies like , , , , , .
-   : Initially the main entry point, transformed to render  as the primary view, managing bottom tab overlays.
-   : Created to wrap all routes with  using 's layout system, ensuring consistent state access.
-   : Central game screen containing the battle arena logic, character, enemies, and controls. This file was created to encapsulate the core action-RPG elements.
-   : Manages the global game state (ninja stats, resources, XP, level, enemies). It was significantly modified to include , , , and  functions, along with game loop logic for auto-combat, spawning, and movement.
-   : Initially used for navigation, then simplified or removed as 's file-based routing took precedence.
-   : Initial versions of screens like , , etc., were created. These were later refactored or repurposed into overlay components.
-   : Component responsible for rendering the bottom navigation bar and managing the visibility of the overlay modals.
-   : New files like , , etc., were created to function as modals that open from the bottom tabs, containing the content previously intended for full screens.
-   : Component for rendering the player's ninja character, including its animated movement logic.
-   : Component for rendering individual enemies, including health bars.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **XP bar visibility:** The XP bar, though created, is not displaying on the main screen.
-   **Level-up bug:** The ninja character is not leveling up when the experience bar fills, despite XP accumulation.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing two critical bugs reported by the user: the missing XP bar on the main screen and the non-functional level-up system.

**Current State:**
The game features a main battle arena () where the ninja character auto-fights up to 10 continuously spawning enemies. The character's movement, intended to be smooth, still exhibits instant teleportation, which was partially addressed by attempting to separate state updates from animation. The game maintains a  () that manages player stats, resources (Gold, Gems, Skill Points), health, energy, and experience. Experience points are awarded per kill, and the system is designed for incremental EXP scaling up to level 15000, granting 3 stat points per level. Bottom tab navigation is implemented, opening various game features (Stats, Shurikens, Pets, Training, Raid, Realm) as overlay modals.

**Recent Actions and Issues:**
The AI attempted to fix the level-up bug by moving the  and related functions within  before the  statement, assuming an incorrect placement issue. It also tried to add the XP bar to the main screen. However, after these changes, screenshots revealed that the XP bar is still not visible, and the level remains at 1 despite the player accumulating XP. This indicates the level-up logic is still flawed, and the XP bar's rendering or integration into the  needs further investigation.

<optional_next_step>
Address the missing XP bar and fix the level-up bug where the level does not increase when the XP bar fills.
