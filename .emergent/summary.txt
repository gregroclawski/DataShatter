The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing and fixing critical frontend issues for the Idle Ninja Online Expo mobile application. The trajectory details an iterative debugging process, addressing React 19 compatibility, hooks order violations, null/object rendering, infinite update loops, and cross-component state conflicts. Initial efforts involved package version adjustments and extensive cache clearing. A major challenge was the authentication flow, which required fixing CORS configuration in the backend () and correcting  in the frontend  file due to environment changes, coupled with implementing a robust DOM event listener fallback for React Native's / on web. After achieving successful login and initial UI rendering in the web preview, the focus shifted to mobile-specific UI/UX issues reported by the user on iPhone, specifically related to skill bar positioning and bottom tab functionality. The current task involves a comprehensive mobile optimization for varying screen sizes.

The application is an Idle Ninja Online style mobile RPG. It features an auto-fighting character across 50 zones (5 levels each, 1000 enemy defeats). Progression includes XP to level 15000, 3 stat points per level, and level-up explosions. The UI has a battle arena with bottom tabs for Stats, Abilities, Pets, Skills, Store, Raids, and Equipment, appearing as overlays. A tick-based combat engine is foundational. Implemented features include a 50-zone system, 25-level gear progression with material upgrades, and a Boss Battle System with 4 bosses across 5 tiers, daily tickets, and specific drops. Boss battles feature unique backgrounds, element-specific attacks, WIN/DEFEAT popups, 3 player lives with a 5-second respawn, and dynamic boss sizing/difficulty. The UI adopted a Mythic-Tech theme with futuristic aesthetics, neon elements, and a compact top bar with vertically stacked resources. Enemies are cleared during boss fights, and bosses are 3x larger. The current development includes a comprehensive, secure server-side login and progression system to prevent client-side cheating, with an upcoming need for Companions and Idle/Offline Progression.

<code_architecture>
**Directory Structure:**


- : Main FastAPI backend.
    - **Importance**: Handles API routing, database, authentication, and game save/load.
    - **Changes**: CORS  updated to include  to resolve authentication issues.
- : Main game screen and entry point.
    - **Importance**: Renders game, overlays, navigation. Controls app flow.
    - **Changes**: Underwent extensive debugging for rendering issues, React hooks order, null/object access, and infinite loops. Debug logs were added to monitor authentication state. Combat auto-start was re-enabled. Styling adjustments were made to correctly position the  and improve bottom navigation for mobile.
- : Root layout for Expo Router.
    - **Importance**: Global navigation and context providers.
    - **Changes**: Inspected, but no direct changes were made in the recent trajectory. The previous AI had configured Stack navigation and integrated context providers.
- : Manages user authentication.
    - **Importance**: Provides auth state, , ,  functions, session persistence.
    - **Changes**: Was thoroughly reviewed to debug login issues; found to be logically correct, but issues stemmed from API URL configuration and button event handling. No direct code modifications were mentioned in this segment.
- : Authentication/Registration UI.
    - **Importance**: User login and registration interface.
    - **Changes**: Debugging logs were added to  and button  events.  was replaced with . A hybrid solution using both React Native  and a DOM event listener fallback was implemented for the login button to ensure reliable functionality across web and mobile.
- : Handles the in-game combat display.
    - **Importance**: Displays health bars, abilities, and enemy information during combat.
    - **Changes**: Initial  style causing incorrect positioning was identified. It was then repositioned correctly near the bottom, above the navigation tabs. The  prop was identified as missing in  when passing to .
- : Frontend environment variables.
    - **Importance**: Stores configuration like backend API URL.
    - **Changes**:  was modified by the AI to match the correct frontend domain  to resolve API communication issues.

<pending_tasks>
- **Backend Persistence**: Ensure all game systems (Companions, etc.) are properly integrated with server-side save/load mechanisms.
- **Companions**: Implement battle and support pets with leveling and abilities.
- **Idle/Offline Progression**: Simulate combat mathematically while offline for accumulated rewards, integrating with the new server-side progression.
- **PlayFab Integration**: Evaluate and potentially integrate PlayFab as a game backend service.
- **Frontend Expo Go Compatibility**: Fully resolve the 3 errors reported in Expo Go, potentially related to ,  import, and  issues.
- **Progress Persistence Reliability**: Investigate and fix the recurring issue of user progress being overwritten by default Level 1 data.
- **Comprehensive Mobile Optimization**: Optimize the entire project for mobile gaming across varying screen sizes and ensure correct layout in Expo Go.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a comprehensive mobile optimization effort for the application, specifically addressing layout inconsistencies observed when running the app on an iPhone via Expo Go. This follows a successful resolution of critical login and UI rendering issues in the web preview environment.

The previous work involved:
1.  **CORS Fix**: Correcting the  in  to include the correct frontend preview URL.
2.  **Backend URL Mismatch**: Updating  in  to match the active frontend domain.
3.  **Login Button Reliability**: Implementing a hybrid event listener approach in  (using React Native  with a DOM event listener fallback) to ensure the login button  event fired consistently across web platforms, ultimately resolving the inability to log in.
4.  **Initial UI Rendering**: Debugging  to ensure the main game UI renders after successful authentication and game data loading, including re-enabling combat auto-start.
5.  **Initial Mobile Layout Fixes**: Adjusting styling and component positioning in  and  to correct the skill bar placement (moved from top to bottom) and improve bottom navigation tab functionality and touch areas on iPhone.

Despite these fixes, the user reported that the layout in the Expo Go app on an iPhone was still messed up, with the skill bar and bottom tabs not functioning properly. The current work has just begun addressing this, starting with a comprehensive review of the layout system to move from fixed dimensions to responsive design, handle safe areas properly, and adjust for different screen sizes.
