The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on enhancing the Idle Ninja Online style mobile RPG by iteratively addressing user requests and bug reports. Initial efforts involved a major refactor of the UI overlay system from Modals to a unified View-based approach to resolve interaction issues. Subsequent development implemented a sophisticated boss battle system with countdowns, multiple lives, and WIN/DEFEAT popups, coupled with dynamic boss sizing and difficulty. Significant effort was then directed towards fixing persistent UI layering and combat zone overlap issues, culminating in a complete architectural shift for the BossBattleScreen to a root-level render. A major visual overhaul to a Mythic-Tech theme was initiated, transforming UI aesthetics and layout. The current task involves building a robust, secure authentication and server-side progression system, ensuring cheat prevention and scalability for an online idle RPG.

<product_requirements>
The application is an Idle Ninja Online style mobile RPG featuring an auto-fighting character against auto-spawning enemies across 50 zones, each with 5 levels and 1000 enemy defeats. Progression includes XP scaling to level 15000, 3 stat points per level, and a level-up explosion. The UI centers on a battle arena with bottom tabs for Stats, Abilities, Pets, Skills, Store, Raids, and Equipment, appearing as overlays. A tick-based combat engine is foundational. Implemented features include the 50-zone system, 25-level gear progression with material-based upgrades, and a Boss Battle System with 4 bosses across 5 tiers, daily tickets, and specific drops. Boss battles are enhanced with unique backgrounds, element-specific attacks, WIN/DEFEAT popups, 3 player lives with a 5-second respawn, and zone transitions. The UI has been visually transformed to a Mythic-Tech theme, featuring futuristic aesthetics, neon elements, and a compact top bar with vertically stacked resources. Enemies are cleared during boss fights, and bosses are 3x larger. Upcoming features include Companions, Idle/Offline Progression, and a full, secure server-side login and progression system.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer initiated the implementation of a comprehensive login and server-side progression system for the Mythic-Tech Idle RPG. This is a significant shift, transforming the game from a local experience to a secure online RPG. The user explicitly requested a security-first approach to prevent client-side cheating.

The AI engineer has:
1.  **Acknowledged** the user's detailed requirements for account creation (email/password, third-party logins), secure credential storage (hashed passwords), session token generation, and server-side player profile fetching (level, items, stats, idle progress).
2.  **Understood** that all critical gameplay logic (idle progression, combat math, real-time events, currency transactions) must be calculated on the server to prevent exploits.
3.  **Confirmed** a security-first approach and outlined plans for comprehensive server-side validation.
4.  **Completed** an internal thought process for creating a comprehensive integration playbook for a secure system, which includes a basic JWT authentication flow blueprint.
