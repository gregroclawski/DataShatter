<analysis>
The development trajectory transitioned from fixing severe infrastructure and data persistence bugs to implementing complex game balancing and core architectural improvements. Initial efforts successfully resolved network connectivity issues caused by environment forking (stale  URLs) and fortified the backend name change feature against race conditions using MongoDB unique indexes. A major focus was correcting recurring React state update violations in  and , which required moving projectile impact and damage calculation into an asynchronous, dedicated  loop for stability. Game progression was aggressively scaled (10 zones for 15,000 levels, 6x XP, 100x gold) and combat was balanced by normalizing massive enemy HP/Attack values. The current phase involves implementing the Revival System, with core state management and UI components created and integrated, pending final store and combat loop verification.

<product_requirements>
Idle Ninja Online is a mobile RPG featuring auto-combat across 10 major zones (5 levels each, total 15,000 character levels). Core requirements include persistent character progression, a sophisticated store offering subscriptions and items, and a character management system.

**Implemented Features/Balance:**
- **Progression Scaling:** Aggressive XP and Gold boost (100x gold, 6x base XP), new 10-zone structure for balanced leveling.
- **Combat System:** Full two-way combat enabled (enemies now damage the player), max enemies increased to 20, projectile/AOE kill tracking fixed, and enemy/player damage normalized.
- **Character Upgrades:** Attack/Defense/Speed upgrades separated into Gold (less effective) and Skill Points (3x more effective), with Level 0 accessibility fixed.
- **Revival System (In Progress):** Implementation of a death countdown modal () requiring Revive Tickets (50 tickets for 1000 Gems in the store).
- **Quality & Stability:** Critical fixes for React render violations, login/network errors, and name uniqueness race conditions.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Expo & Expo Router**: Mobile app framework using file-based routing.
- **FastAPI/MongoDB**: Backend services; MongoDB indexing used for case-insensitive unique usernames.
- **React Context**: Used for global state (, ), employing asynchronous state updates () to resolve React render-phase errors.
- **Game Balancing**: Implemented scaled enemy stats via mathematical formulas in  to support high-level progression.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
**Directory Structure:**


- :
    - Critical for name change stability. Added MongoDB unique index with collation on  field. Modified name change logic to exclude the current user ID and handle .
- :
    - Main rendering loop. Removed synchronous state updates related to projectiles. Added  and integrated the new  component.
- :
    - **Crucial Changes:** Implemented enemy attack logic. Fixed React render-phase state violation by moving projectile damage processing into a new, separate asynchronous  loop that manages damage application and projectile removal. Added  and  states. Increased  to 20.
- :
    - Added  to . Implemented  and . Fixed stat sync logic to prevent overriding current player health.
- :
    - Redesigned zone structure to 10 zones, each with 5 levels (covering 300 character levels per level). Normalized enemy HP/Attack calculation by scaling the exponential factors down by 100 to balance combat.
- :
    - Updated stat upgrade functions to differentiate gold and skill point benefits (skill points are 3x better). Fixed the cost calculation base to enable level 0 gold upgrades.
- : **(NEW)**
    - Component for displaying player death and revival options, including a 10-second countdown timer.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the integration of the Revive Ticket purchase flow in .
- Backend Persistence: Ensure all game systems (specifically Companions, which are pending implementation) are integrated with server-side save/load mechanisms.
- Implement battle and support pets (Companions).
- Implement Idle/Offline Progression simulation.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent work involved implementing the core framework for the player revival system. This required significant additions across the codebase:
1.  **Game State:**  added to  in .
2.  **Combat Logic:** Player death detection, setting  state, and exposing revival controls were added to .
3.  **UI Component:** A new component, , was created to manage the 10-second revival countdown and options (use ticket or respawn).
4.  **Integration:** The  has been integrated into the main game screen () to display when the player dies.
5.  **Store Item Definition:** The item for 50 Revive Tickets costing 1000 Gems was defined in .

The previous engineer successfully merged these changes and was in the process of restarting the frontend to confirm the full integration before proceeding to complete the purchase flow.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the  is displayed correctly on player death and then finalize the Revive Ticket purchase logic in .
