The AI engineer's work centered on stabilizing the Idle Ninja Online Expo mobile application. The trajectory documents an intensive debugging process, primarily addressing a cascade of frontend rendering, compatibility, and logic errors. Initial efforts fixed critical React 19 compatibility issues, involving version adjustments for React, React Native Reanimated, and Expo Router, alongside extensive cache clearing. This led to a series of errors: React hooks order violations, null property access, object rendering issues, infinite update loops, cross-component state update conflicts, and persistent UI layout disruptions. Each problem was tackled iteratively through targeted code modifications, simplification, and progressive restoration. The latest phase focuses on systematically rebuilding the main game UI in  after finally resolving all underlying rendering and syntax issues, confirming basic component functionality.

The application is an Idle Ninja Online style mobile RPG. It features an auto-fighting character across 50 zones (5 levels each, 1000 enemy defeats). Progression includes XP to level 15000, 3 stat points per level, and level-up explosions. The UI has a battle arena with bottom tabs for Stats, Abilities, Pets, Skills, Store, Raids, and Equipment, appearing as overlays. A tick-based combat engine is foundational. Implemented features include a 50-zone system, 25-level gear progression with material upgrades, and a Boss Battle System with 4 bosses across 5 tiers, daily tickets, and specific drops. Boss battles feature unique backgrounds, element-specific attacks, WIN/DEFEAT popups, 3 player lives with a 5-second respawn, and dynamic boss sizing/difficulty. The UI adopted a Mythic-Tech theme with futuristic aesthetics, neon elements, and a compact top bar with vertically stacked resources. Enemies are cleared during boss fights, and bosses are 3x larger. The current development includes a comprehensive, secure server-side login and progression system to prevent client-side cheating, with an upcoming need for Companions and Idle/Offline Progression.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into resolving a complex set of frontend UI and rendering issues on the main game combat page. After successfully fixing numerous critical errors including React 19 compatibility, React hooks order violations, null/object rendering errors, infinite update loops, cross-component state update conflicts, and proper initialization sequence for the  object, the main UI of the game was still appearing as a dark/blank screen after login.

The latest debugging confirmed that the core component was finally rendering correctly and all essential logic (authentication, game data loading, combat ticks) was functioning. A breakthrough was achieved by simplifying the  file to a minimal test UI, which successfully rendered, proving the fundamental rendering pipeline was intact. The current work involves progressively restoring the full  to display the complete game interface, building upon the now stable rendering foundation. The first step of this restoration has been completed, with debug logs confirming that the full UI structure is now attempting to render and game data is accessible.
