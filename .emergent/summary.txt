The trajectory documents an extensive and complex debugging journey for a mobile RPG, Data Shatter. The initial task was to fix a minor visual lag on the XP bar. This simple request quickly spiraled into a deep dive into the application's core architecture, revealing numerous critical bugs.

The AI engineer systematically addressed a cascade of issues, many diagnosed by a . Key problems included: Metro bundler caching hiding code changes, duplicate React Context providers causing state conflicts, infinite re-render loops from incorrect  usage, and multiple stale closure problems breaking the combat logic after level-ups.

A significant portion of the work focused on the  file. The engineer fixed conflicting damage and XP systems, resolved state mutation bugs, corrected projectile despawning logic, and critically, implemented a missing combat tick timer that was preventing the entire reward system from running. The root cause of many visual bugs was traced back to fundamental architectural flaws, such as incorrect enemy HP scaling in  and a state timing issue where the list of killed enemies wasn't being captured correctly for processing.

After resolving these core system failures, the work shifted to user-requested balance changes (adjusting XP, gold, and zone difficulty) and UI tweaks (styling the XP notification text). The final task before this summary was to investigate an influx of save errors, which was diagnosed as a performance issue due to excessive, unthrottled save requests to the backend.

<product_requirements>
The application, Data Shatter, is an idle RPG for mobile platforms designed for fast-paced progression.

**Core Features & Gameplay Loop:**
- **Automated Combat:** The player's character automatically fights waves of enemies in different zones.
- **Progression:** Players gain Experience (XP) and Gold from defeating enemies to level up, which fully restores health and energy.
- **Economy:** Players use Gold for in-game purchases. Gems are the premium currency, used for items like Revive Tickets.
- **Revival System:** Upon death, players can revive using tickets. This system was temporarily disabled to debug other critical issues but has since been restored.
- **UI Feedback:** A custom UI component provides animated feedback for XP gains (+### XP) to enhance the sense of progression.
- **Admin Functionality:** A backend system allows specific users to reset their game state for testing purposes.

**Recent Implementation History:**
The application underwent a massive debugging effort to fix the entire combat reward pipeline. This included resolving issues with enemy death detection, projectile physics, XP/gold awarding, and zone progress tracking, which were all non-functional on mobile devices. The game balance was recently adjusted to slow XP gain by 50%, increase gold rewards by 100x, and increase zone kill requirements by 10x.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frameworks**: Expo (with Expo Router), React Native, FastAPI.
- **State Management**: Heavy reliance on React Context (, , ). Debugging focused on fixing stale closures, state mutation, and dependency array issues in  and . React Refs () were introduced to solve critical closure scoping problems.
- **Build & Environment**: Addressed critical issues with the Metro bundler cache, which was preventing code changes from appearing on mobile devices.
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimized the combat tick rate specifically for mobile () to prevent performance bottlenecks.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the core of the game's real-time logic, managing the entire combat loop, including enemy state, projectile physics, damage calculation, and reward processing.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: This file was the epicenter of the debugging effort. Changes included: removing duplicate/conflicting damage and XP systems, fixing multiple stale closure bugs by correctly managing  dependency arrays, implementing a React Ref () to solve a critical state timing issue, adding a missing  to run the main combat tick, optimizing the tick rate for mobile, and adjusting XP/gold reward calculations based on user request.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The main game screen component, responsible for rendering all UI elements and integrating the various contexts.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Fixed a critical bug where the UI was displaying derived stats instead of the actual loaded game state from , causing progression to appear broken. A new UI feature for displaying stacking XP gain notifications () was added, including state management, JSX rendering with , and styling. The styling was later adjusted to be smaller and more opaque.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The root layout file for the Expo Router, responsible for wrapping the application in global context providers.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: A critical architectural flaw was fixed here by removing duplicated nested context providers (e.g.,  wrapping , which already contained ). This resolved major state conflicts.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Contains static data and logic for game zones, including enemy stats and progression requirements.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Fixed a fundamental bug where enemy HP scaling logic caused all enemies to spawn with exactly 1 HP, preventing them from being killed properly. Also updated the logic to increase the number of kills required to complete zones by a factor of 10, per a user request for game balance changes.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Manages persistent player data, including saving/loading state from the backend.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: This file was investigated for the current save errors issue. It was identified that it lacks a throttling mechanism for the  function, which is the likely cause of the performance problem.
</code_architecture>
<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Save Throttling**: Investigate the frequent save requests reported by the user and implement a throttling or debouncing mechanism in  to prevent overwhelming the backend.
- **Implement Companions**: A planned game feature that has not been started.
- **Implement Idle/Offline Progression**: A core feature for an idle RPG that has not been implemented yet.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the user reported getting a lot of save errors. The AI engineer investigated the backend logs and determined that the save requests were succeeding with a 200 OK status, but they were being sent with extremely high frequency, including many duplicate requests with identical data.

The investigation shifted to the frontend to understand what was triggering these rapid saves. The AI hypothesized that the frequent state updates from the now-functional combat and XP systems were causing the game to save too often.

The last action taken was to examine the  file to look for a save throttling mechanism. The engineer confirmed that no such mechanism exists, which is the likely root cause of the performance issue. The work stopped just before the engineer was about to investigate what specific state changes were triggering the  function calls so frequently. The immediate goal is to prevent these excessive save requests to improve backend performance and resolve the user's perceived errors.
</current_work>
<optional_next_step>
I will add a throttling mechanism to the  function in  to limit the frequency of save requests to the backend.
